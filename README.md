# Website-Assignment
assignment 3 - website design from wireframe

What does the project do?

The project website "Cases-R-us" provides entertainment and a established market in providing skins for all the users where the users can choose to both buy and sell their skins or open the randomised cases. From this, an age verification is required as their are random items and an attribute thats similar to stock trading. 

----------------------------------------

For users:

Jake Miller:
It allows Jake to both buy new skins and sell the ones he is currently not using. The odds of the randomised lootboxes will be displayed on each container so that everyone is informed of the random items from the drop pool. There are also added charts that keep track of all prices on the market, included the cases, to give those that want to view the analytical data access to it. 

Ryan Foster: 
There are applications that will allow Ryan to export the values of his inventory to that of an excel sheet to allow for easy access to price data. There will been notifications that send to both the email app and the mobile app if an item or case has hit a specific price set by the user so they can buy/sell. 

----------------------------------------

Production and designing:

When producing the website, I had revised the wireframe to consist of a joint page for the whole website to add a more simplified function for the users, ensuring that they cannot get "lost" in the different web pages. I have also added links on the main heading to direct the user to specific pages that they require. 

----------------------------------------

How to run the project:

Firstly, you enter teh web address to enter the website to enter the domain, this should bring you to the home page. Next there are either the options on the main bar at the top of the screen ot bring you to the corresponding sections of the site or you can scroll through the pages to the desired page. After this, when the website would be officially released there will be multiple tabs available and segments to go into the available applications on the website.

----------------------------------------

Testing:

There was multiple instances of the html code not giving the correct page or not directing the headings to the pages. This was due to the "a" tags not being in the correct area as they were under the "class = section" area and not the "class = inventory" area where it was meant to be. From this I tested until I was able to have the headings direct to the correct pages for the website. 

Another issue that arose was the top bar heading was not moving with the page and being clear instead of white. This was mainly in the CSS file where I found the "top bar" section and added code to make the bar stay at the top of the page. I then made the bar be in front of the images so that the bar is always present for the user so they retain access to all pages.  

The top bar had another issue that involved having a clear background instead of having a white background. This was orginally from the way i coded the website as it was on the basis of the whole web page having a white background and everything else being either outlined or filled in with colour afterwards. I had solved this issue by adding a seperate colour background for the top bar so it had a solid white colour.
